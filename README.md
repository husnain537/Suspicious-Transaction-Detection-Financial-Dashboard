# Suspicious-Transaction-Detection-Financial-Dashboard
This project simulates a real-world junior data analyst role in the finance domain. The dataset contains over 5,000 financial transactions across multiple branches, with fields such as transaction type, amount, sender/receiver IDs, and notes.

The goal was to:
•	Clean, messy data (e.g., missing notes, invalid characters, suspicious patterns)

•	Detect anomalies such as same sender and receiver, very large transfers, and blank fields

•	Build an interactive dashboard using Pivot Tables, Filters, and Charts

•	Extract actionable business insights to support financial decision-making
